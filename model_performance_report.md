2. Implement product similarity features
3. Add real-time competitor price tracking
4. Enhance seasonal pattern recognition

## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1 Short-term Improvements
1. Implement category-specific model tuning
2. Add more granular time features
3. Enhance feature engineering for market conditions
4. Implement dynamic feature selection

### 6.2 Long-term Enhancements
1. Develop separate models for different price ranges
2. Implement ensemble methods
3. Add deep learning components for pattern recognition
4. Incorporate more external data sources

## 7. Conclusion
The dynamic pricing model demonstrates strong overall performance with an R² score of 0.89 and MAPE of 4.8%. The model shows particular strength in predicting prices for established product categories while maintaining reasonable accuracy across all product types. The feature importance analysis reveals that base price and sales performance are the most significant predictors, which aligns with business intuition.
